# Matrix Benchmark

This project implements basic matrix operations and a **custom Gaussian elimination solver** in Python, and compares its performance with **NumPy's linear system solver**.

---

## Features

- Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Determinant and inverse calculation
- Gaussian elimination to solve linear systems
- Benchmarking against NumPy's `linalg.solve`
